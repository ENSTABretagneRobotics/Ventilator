The printed parts were obtained using the FDM method through an Ultimaker 3 Extended printer using Ultimaker CURA as the slicer.

This folder contains the parts that have to be 3D printed. They are divided into two types depending on the required accuracy:
- Normal nozzle diameter: 0.40 mm
- High-definition nozzle diameter: 0.25 mm

ATTENTION: STL files do not show the parts in the correct printing orientation. To know the correct part orientation and printing configurations check 3MF files in CURA slicer.
